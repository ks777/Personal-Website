<b><font size="4"><font color ="black">Hey there. This is just a mock website I`ve been slowly working on for the past few weeks to remind myself of html and css. I plan to do some silly, wacky things to this website as practice sessions. In the end, I`m just trying to get better as a programmer, get off my lazy ass, and try to code if possible on my downtime/as I`m searching for a job to earn income on the side. I do want to remind myself of my aspirations: to develop my own videogame. I know learning html/css won`t get me to programming a videogame, but its something I`ve been meaning to learn. Here`s hoping I can start coding soon and build up my very, very limited portfolio. <br><br><br></font>While you check around, here`s some music to soothe the soul.</font><br></b>

<font size="4"><font color = "black">I`ve pretty much been an anime fanatic for as long as I can remember. I remember in my youth, I would go to conventions and spend a lot of time in anime discussion forums. Nowadays, I`ve eased up a bit on the fandom, enjoying an occasional show every now-and-then. Though I don`t think I`ll completely stop watching anime. Hell, even now I`m planning to go to my yearly anime convention.</font></font><br>

<h2><font size="4"><font color = "black">Having no social life, I decided to fill my life with videogames. Starting with Team Fortress 2 and forward, I`ve spent a good portion of my youth in fictional worlds under the sea or in a hell-infested Mars. In retrospective, I should have been coding, but you can`t change the past. I still play videogames to this day, as It's just too much fun. Bioshock is still my GOAT.</font></font><br></h2>

That`s not to say I haven`t experienced coding or have no idea how to code, but when it comes to self-projects and intuition of the language, I possess very little of it. I`m trying to fix that today by getting into the habit of daily coding or learning languages, but its a climb that should have been done around 3 years ago.  </font></font><br></h5>

<h3><font color = "green">World of Warcraft</font><h3>
<h2><font size="4"><font color = "black">As i have previously mentioned, I`m a pretty Avid WoW player. This addiction of mine started during my junior year of College, when me and some friends rented out an apartment for a year. It was a wonderous experience and probably the best year I`ve had in college. Though, when we became comfortable with each other, We realized that most of us played World of Warcraft and so i decided to try it out. Anyway, I still continue to play with some friends and try to not make WoW most of my day, nowadays.</font></font><br></h2>
